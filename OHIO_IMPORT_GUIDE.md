# Ohio Legal Research Tool - Import Guide

## Summary

Great news! Your project is **ready to become a Casetext alternative for Ohio attorneys**. CourtListener has comprehensive Ohio coverage:

- **87,729** Ohio Supreme Court cases
- **Thousands** of Ohio Court of Appeals cases
- **Thousands** of Ohio Court of Claims cases
- **62,683** 6th Circuit federal cases (covers Ohio)

## What We've Built

### 1. Research & Discovery âœ…
- Identified Ohio court IDs in CourtListener:
  - `ohio` - Ohio Supreme Court
  - `ohioctapp` - Ohio Court of Appeals
  - `ohioctcl` - Ohio Court of Claims
  - `ca6` - 6th Circuit (federal)

### 2. Import Scripts Ready âœ…
- Created `scripts/import_ohio_cases.py` - comprehensive Ohio import script
- Target: 10,000+ cases for initial launch
  - 2,000 Ohio Supreme Court
  - 5,000 Ohio Court of Appeals
  - 2,000 6th Circuit
  - 500 Ohio Court of Claims

### 3. Next Steps

## How to Import Ohio Cases

### Prerequisites

1. **Start Docker** (for PostgreSQL database)
   ```bash
   # Make sure Docker Desktop is running, then:
   cd /Volumes/T7/Scripts/AI\ Law\ Researcher/legal-research-tool
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Verify Database is Running**
   ```bash
   psql "postgresql://legal_user:legal_pass@localhost:5432/legal_research" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cases;"
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables** (optional but recommended)
   Create/update `.env` file:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://legal_user:legal_pass@localhost:5432/legal_research
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   COURTLISTENER_TOKEN=your_courtlistener_token_here  # Get free at courtlistener.com
   ```

### Running the Import

```bash
cd /Volumes/T7/Scripts/AI\ Law\ Researcher/legal-research-tool
python3 scripts/import_ohio_cases.py
```

**Expected Duration:** 2-4 hours for 10,000 cases (with rate limiting)

### What the Import Does

1. **Fetches cases** from CourtListener for each Ohio court
2. **Retrieves full opinion text** where available
3. **Generates AI embeddings** for semantic search (uses OpenAI API)
4. **Stores in PostgreSQL** with vector search capabilities
5. **Rate limiting** to be respectful to CourtListener's API

### Monitor Progress

The script will show:
- Progress updates every 10 cases
- Total cases imported per court
- Final database statistics
- Top 10 most-cited Ohio cases

## Why This Makes Business Sense

### Market Opportunity

**Current Options:**
- Westlaw: $100-500/user/month â†’ $1,200-6,000/year per attorney
- Lexis+: Similar pricing
- Casetext (now Thomson Reuters): Was $89-250/month

**Your Opportunity:**
- **Target:** Solo practitioners and small firms in Ohio
- **Value Prop:** Deep Ohio coverage at affordable price
- **Differentiator:** "Best Ohio legal research tool" vs. "another Westlaw clone"

### Why Ohio-First Works

1. **Solo practitioners work locally** - they need deep state coverage, not shallow national coverage
2. **Manageable scope** - You can achieve comprehensive coverage of Ohio courts
3. **Real differentiation** - No affordable Ohio-specific tool exists
4. **Proof of concept** - If it works for Ohio, expand to other states

### What Makes Your Tool Competitive

Based on your existing features:
- âœ… **AI-powered search** (hybrid semantic + keyword)
- âœ… **AI case summaries** (like Casetext's CARA)
- âœ… **Brief citation checking** (Casetext's killer feature)
- âœ… **Free data source** (CourtListener - sustainable)
- âœ… **Modern interface** (Next.js, clean UX)
- âœ… **Cost-efficient** (~$0.002 per AI summary)

## After Import: Next Steps

### Phase 1: Polish Core Features (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Test search** with real Ohio cases
2. **Add Ohio filters** to UI (Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, etc.)
3. **Improve AI summaries** to highlight Ohio-specific law
4. **Test brief-checking** with Ohio briefs

### Phase 2: Ohio-Specific Features (Weeks 3-4)
1. **Ohio court rules** and local rules
2. **Ohio citation format** (Bluebook)
3. **Popular Ohio case database** (top-cited, landmark cases)
4. **Ohio-specific search filters** (by district, year, topic)

### Phase 3: User Testing (Weeks 5-6)
1. **Find 5-10 Ohio attorneys** for feedback
2. **Run usability tests** with real research tasks
3. **Gather feedback** on missing features
4. **Iterate** based on feedback

### Phase 4: Monetization Planning (Weeks 7-8)
1. **Add user authentication** (Clerk or Auth.js)
2. **Design pricing tiers:**
   - Free tier: 10 searches/month, basic summaries
   - Solo: $29-49/month (individual attorneys)
   - Small firm: $99-149/month (2-5 attorneys)
   - Firm: $249+/month (5+ attorneys)
3. **Stripe integration** for billing
4. **Marketing website** highlighting Ohio coverage

## Expansion Strategy

Once Ohio proves successful:

### Year 1: Adjacent States
- **Pennsylvania** (neighbor state, 6th Circuit)
- **Michigan** (neighbor state, 6th Circuit)
- **Kentucky** (neighbor state, 6th Circuit)

### Year 2: Regional Focus
- **All 6th Circuit states** (complete regional dominance)
- **Popular states:** California, Texas, New York, Florida

### Year 3: National
- **All 50 states** (become true Westlaw alternative)
- **Specialized courts** (bankruptcy, tax, etc.)
- **Law school edition** (research training)

## Technical Notes

### Database Capacity
Your current schema with pgvector can handle:
- âœ… 10,000 cases: Easy
- âœ… 100,000 cases: No problem
- âœ… 1,000,000+ cases: Will need index optimization

### Cost Estimates (Production)

**For 10,000 Ohio cases:**
- Storage: ~5GB â†’ $0.50/month
- Embeddings: 10,000 Ã— $0.0001 = ~$1 (one-time)
- AI summaries: On-demand, ~$0.002 each
- Database: DigitalOcean $15/month or AWS RDS $25/month

**Monthly operating costs:**
- Database: $15-25
- Hosting (frontend/backend): $10-20
- AI usage (100 summaries/day): ~$6
- **Total: ~$30-50/month** for 10,000-case database

**Revenue potential:**
- 10 paying users Ã— $29/month = $290/month
- 50 paying users Ã— $29/month = $1,450/month
- 100 paying users Ã— $29/month = $2,900/month

## Questions?

The import script is ready to run as soon as you start Docker and the database.

**Key files created:**
1. `/scripts/import_ohio_cases.py` - Main import script
2. `/scripts/get_ohio_courts.py` - Court discovery tool
3. `/scripts/test_ohio_search.py` - Search testing tool
4. `/ohio_courts.json` - Court metadata

**To start importing:**
```bash
# Start database
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for database to be ready (10-30 seconds)
sleep 30

# Run import
python3 scripts/import_ohio_cases.py
```

Good luck building the Ohio Legal Research Tool! ðŸŽ‰
